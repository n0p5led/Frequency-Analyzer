# Frequency-Analyzer
This is a very basic python script that analyzes the frequency of every byte in a ciphertext.
It can be used to break weak encryptions.

To use it, you must pass as an argument the name of a file which contains the ciphertext. For example:
python frequency_analysis.py ciphertext.bin
